# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
The data set contains data related to a direct marketing campaigns of a financial institution. The problem setting is a binary classification where our project goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe a term deposit (that is outcome variable y). In the original dataset we have 17 possible predictor variables, both numeric and categorical ones.

During the project we would like to predict whether a given client with a set of previously known attributes (set of inputs) would or would not subscribe a term deposit.

We would construct a default Ml pipeline for that with the basic steps of:

Data cleaning and preparation
Model building - including optimizing the hyperparameters as well (on a test/valid set).
Model performance evaluation step on a held-out-set.
Thus we would use all the 3 part of the dataset namely the train / test / validation sets for different purposes. We show how to set up the above pipeline from a jupyter-notebook and execute it through the Azure ML studio. For the hyperparameter tuning part we use Hyperdrive functionality of the ML-studio.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
